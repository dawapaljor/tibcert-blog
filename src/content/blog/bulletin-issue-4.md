# 1. Background
1.1 About TibCERT
The Tibetan Computer Emergency Readiness Team (TibCERT) is a formal, coalition-based structure for reducing and mitigating online threats in the Tibetan community, expanding Tibetans’ technical research capacity on threats in the diaspora, surveillance, and censorship inside Tibet, and ultimately ensuring greater online freedom and security for Tibetan society as a whole.

1.2 Purpose
The purpose of this TibCERT quarterly bulletin is to share updates about TibCERT and offer advice on digital threats observed in the community. We also aim to help Tibetans in the diaspora stay safe physically, emotionally, and digitally during the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as provide resources and awareness on issues surrounding the global pandemic.

1.3 TibCERT Updates
The coronavirus pandemic has affected everyone. Since India is under national lockdown, to maintain social distancing, we are all currently working remotely from home and are continuing to provide support and create digital security resources for our stakeholders and the community. The status of the lockdown is still uncertain at the time of writing and we will continue to provide remote support and have been exploring ways to do virtual training and policy implementation.

1.4 Summary
The fourth edition of the Bulletin features:

1.4.1 Disinformation/Misinformation
Disinformation (shared deliberately) and misinformation (shared accidentally) are fake/unverified pieces of information that can mislead people and cause harm (e.g., through blog posts, texts, WeChat comments, infographics, etc.). In order to help keep the Tibetan community safe during the coronavirus pandemic, TibCERT’s Knowledge Base now has a section where information circulating on COVID-19 can be either verified as true, identified as disinformation/misinformation, or some of both. Please visit https://learn.tibcert.org/category/disinfo-misinfo/ for more information. If you want to verify something that is not yet on the website, please write to support@tibcert.org.  

1.4.2 COVID-19 Updates
There are Tibetans all over the world working to help each other combat and cope with this pandemic. In order to provide a space for Tibetans to find resources ranging from health tips, online training, helplines, tech tips, advice for elders, and more, we created a website to connect the community at https://covid19.tibcert.org/.

Meanwhile in China, authorities and tech companies have launched an effort to stop the spread of the virus through several apps that track people and their level of exposure to COVID-19. However, without their knowledge or consent, each time a person runs the app, their personal data is shared with law enforcement and stored on a server. This raises major privacy concerns, posing a threat that the data is being used for social control which can continue even after this pandemic.

1.4.3 Kaspersky Report
Online privacy group Kaspersky recently published a report on a watering hole attack targeting several Tibetan websites. This kind of online attack compromises the sites and shows a fake pop-up asking the user to install the latest Adobe Flash player. If downloaded, the visitor’s operating system is then infected with malware. Since learning of the attacks through Kaspersky’s report, the TibCERT team has conducted incident response to assist the stakeholders who were compromised.

1.4.4 Digital Security Update

During the COVID-19 pandemic, the Citizen Lab of the University of Toronto conducted research of censorship taking place on WeChat. Using sample testing, researchers discovered keywords that were censored in order to stop the posting of coronavirus-related content. The Citizen Lab also recently published a report on Chinese government surveillance of WeChat through accounts registered outside of China, which authorities are using to improve the censorship algorithm for China-registered accounts. This report contains critical information to help understand WeChat censorship and is an important milestone in surveillance  research given that it is the first report to discuss WeChat surveillance outside of China and Tibet.
TikTok, owned by ByteDance, has several security risks and vulnerabilities that allow attackers to use malicious links that seem to be from TikTok in order to gain access to user accounts. Attackers can then manipulate the account’s content, upload and delete videos, and access personal information such as private email addresses. It has also been discovered that TikTok has been censoring issues such as the Tiananmen Square massacre, Tibetan independence, the religious group Falun Gong, widely publicized pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong, Chinese government oppression of the Uyghur Muslim population, and other issues that criticize the social structure of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). In addition, TikTok has sent emails to the company’s India content moderation team to remove any content related to His Holiness the Dalai Lama and Tibet. This shows how TikTok has been trying to control content being posted outside of China as well.
In order to maintain social distancing during this pandemic, many people started working from home, leading to the rise of the use of video conferencing tools. Through its usability, Zoom became the tool that most people adopted and, in some ways, “Let’s Zoom” has become similar to “Let’s Skype,” which used to be synonymous with video calls a few years ago. However, researchers recently found some security issues with Zoom. One of them directly relates to Tibetans as the research showed Zoom data travelling through China. The question on everyone’s mind is, “Is Zoom safe to use and if not, what should we use?” We will explore questions such as these below in more detail, along with the underlying concept of how much we can trust proprietary software.
2. Disinformation/Misinformation
False news is a major problem these days. Individuals and governments are using  social media and other communication platforms to dispatch both misinformation and disinformation. Misinformation refers to the unintentional spread of false information whereas disinformation refers to false information that is deliberately created to harm a person, social group, organization, or country. The spreading of disinformation can blur the lines between reality and fiction and is meant to confuse people. 

Recently, we’ve seen a lot of fake information related to COVID-19 being shared on social media. It can be difficult to tell sometimes what is fake and what is real, but when people forward false content, it amplifies the problem, spreading misinformation and disinformation that can harm the Tibetan community. In order to help the problem, TibCERT began researching these false news items and sharing the correct information on our Knowledge Base website at https://learn.tibcert.org/category/disinfo-misinfo/. 

Three important examples of misinformation/disinformation are as follow:

On March 16th, 2020, fake news spread that His Holiness the Dalai Lama had advised Tibetans to drink black tea for the prevention of COVID-19. Many people believed this to be true and the information went viral on social media. Soon after, the Office of His Holiness the Dalai Lama had to respond to the rumor, making an announcement to clarify that His Holiness was not recommending black tea as a prevention for COVID-19.

Likewise, there was also false news circulating that said a monk from Gaden Jangtse had been infected with COVID-19. This was completely untrue and the Gaden monastery sent out a correction stating that  the monk had tested negative.

Finally, another example of false news circulating in the Tibetan community was about protection from the coronavirus by keeping a picture of a certain spiritual amulet, as done by Sakya Trizin. This was not true and to correct this notion, the Office of Sakya Dolma Phodrang released a statement clarifying that while the amulet can help someone in general, it should not be relied on to help with COVID-19.

Just as it can be said that, “War isn’t new,” it’s also true that misinformation and disinformation aren’t new. What’s different now is that we are living in a digital age where forwarding information is as quick as lightning. People tend to forward messages and stories if they see a catchy headline, without necessarily reading the content or determining if the information is genuine or not. Since misinformation/disinformation can be so harmful, it’s every individual’s responsibility to check whether the content has been verified or not. In addition, it’s very important to report fake content wherever you can, including to TibCERT at submit@tibcert.org. In this way, we can all help keep our community updated with correct and useful information.

Think Before You Share

These days, most people get their news from online sources, relying heavily on mobile devices for communication. It is therefore easy for false information to spread naively and quickly, leading to confusion about what is true and what is not true. Therefore, the best practice you can always take is to “Think Before You Share,” making sure not to forward unverified information to your contacts. In this way, we can help save our community from the effects of receiving and acting on false information.  Since we have elections coming up in a few months, it will be critical for us all to avoid disinformation campaigns. If you come across any suspicious information, feel free to share with us for verification at submit@tibcert.org.

3. COVID-19 Updates
3.1 TibCERT COVID-19 Website
Tibetans in the diaspora are creating and distributing great resources to combat and cope with the ongoing pandemic. In order to collate and share useful information related to COVID-19 for Tibetans all around the world, TibCERT has created a website https://covid19.tibcert.org available in both English and Tibetan.

In particular, the website contains regional helplines for people who are in need of help, health tips to know more about the disease, tips specifically for elders, and basic protective measures to stay safe and help keep others safe as well. We have also included a video of advice from Dr. Tsetan Sadutshang la, Delek Hospital’s Chief Medical Officer and personal physician to His Holiness the Dalai Lama. Since many organizations and individuals are now working from home in order to maintain social distancing, you will also find tech tips on how to keep yourself safer online from digital threats. Finally, to find organizations and individuals working on COVID-19, you can go to the “CONNECT” page on the site.

We are planning to make this website even more resourceful in the coming weeks, including new features like a discussion platform where Tibetans around the world can discuss and meet virtually. In addition, we will create a COVID-19 Volunteer Task Force of people who can physically go help those who are not able to buy groceries, for example, or elders who are alone and in need of connection. When we look back, this website will also serve as an archive demonstrating the power of Tibetan community work during a time of crisis.
